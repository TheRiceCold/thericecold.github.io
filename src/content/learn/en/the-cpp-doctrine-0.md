  From your favorite games to the spacecraft exploring the cosmos — Meet C++.

prologue: >-
  In the realm where every microsecond counts and efficiency is paramount,
  there exists a language that powers our computers,
  the silent force behind our most immersive games,
  and the unyielding brain in our most advanced systems.
  The language where performance is sought.

# Meet C++

Think of C++ as the secret engine powering some of the world's most ambitious and complex technologies —
from your computer’s operating system and the video games you love to high-frequency trading and even self-driving cars.

## Talking to the Machine

C++ speaks the computer's language — literally. As a compiled language,
it translates your code directly into native machine instructions.
Imagine writing in a language your machine speaks fluently,
leaving no room for misunderstandings or delays.
This grants programmers precise control over memory and hardware,
allowing them to squeeze out every last bit of speed and efficiency possible.

## Powering the Digital World

C++ doesn't just build applications — it builds foundations.
It's engine behind countless technologies where performance matters most.
From powering operating systems and browsers we use daily
to forming the core of systems in finance, game development, and space missions,
C++ does the heavy lifting to make sure everything runs fast and smooth.

In fact, the very browser you're using right now is built on C++ technology.

## The Chosen One

When a project's demands exceed hardware limits, when memory is scarce,
and when every CPU cycle counts, the world turns to C++.
It's not just a language; it's the engine digital world.
